# Text-Recognition-in-Image-using-Python
This project processes the image and gets the text embedded in the image. 
The speech output is obtained by processing text to gtts and text can also be translated using text blob and speech output is also obtained for the translated text

There will be a webpage built using html, css and bootstrap.
The webpage has 4 buttons: to text, to speech, to document and to translate.
